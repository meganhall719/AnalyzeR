Description: A package for analyzing and quantifying staining in images. The
    functions provide a workflow for image analysis 'analyze_image()' processes
    a single image with a customizable threshold, 'group_loaded_images()' organizes
    images for batch processing, and 'batch_analyze_images()' analyzes all grouped
    images using the same threshold. The package calculates the percentage difference
    between stained and blank images, providing a quantitative measure of protein
    expression and summary statistics across image batches.
